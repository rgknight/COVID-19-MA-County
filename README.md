# COVID-19-MA-County
County-level data on COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts

The data source is the mass.gov info page for COVID-19: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring

I used the wayback machine to record data for March 9, 2020 through March 12, 2020: https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring

I used the Johns Hopkins data prior to March 9. For some reason Johns Hopkins stopped reporting county level data. The mass.gov and Johns Hopkins count level data idd not always agree for the limited period of overlap. https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series
